# RestaurantManaging
        This program helps the job of the headwaiters of restaurants by making it easier to
        manage the reservations. They have the option to add new customers to the database,
        edit already existing ones if required, delete customers if they leave the restaurant,
        or just simply view the list of all customers currently in the restaurant.
        The database contains their name, the meals they ordered, the time of reservation,
        and the cost of their orders.
